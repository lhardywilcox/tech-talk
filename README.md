## Description

Tech Talk will be a blogging application, where techs can share posts about things they've learned, challenges they face, or any other technical subjects they wish.  In addition, authenticated users will be able to comment on other users' posts, and those comments will be stored for everyone to view later.  

This application is quite challenging for me.  I struggle with organizing how I should start building this, and need to start over with a clean slate, and tackle one piece at a time.  I feel my approach was much too haphazard, and if I can slow down and take a more systematic approach it will benefit my understanding.
